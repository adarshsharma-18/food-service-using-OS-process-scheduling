# Automated Food Ordering System

Automated Food Ordering System is a Python application that aims to optimize customer waiting time and turnaround time by implementing different algorithms for process scheduling. It provides functionalities for Shortest-Job First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Priority scheduling algorithms.

## Features

- Shortest-Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm: Minimizes waiting time by serving the shortest cooking time orders first.
- Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling Algorithm: Dynamically schedules orders based on their remaining cooking time.
- Priority Scheduling Algorithm: Serves orders based on priority, ensuring high-priority orders are processed first.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/adarshsharma-18/food-service-using-OS-process-scheduling.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:


cd automated-food-ordering-system


3. Run the application:

python main.py


4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a scheduling algorithm and input order details.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python installation)
